==== Terms ====
- maxPriorityFeePerGas
  - a cap on the priority_fee specifically
  - essentially eualt to priority_fee
  - however works in tandem with maxFeePerGas if set 
  - default: eth_gasPrice - base_fee
  - low, medium, high references
- maxFeePerGas
  - a cap on base_fee + priority_fee
  - in other words the total amount your willing to pay per gas
  - default: maxPriorityFeePerGas + 2 * base_fee
- base_fee/baseFeeForBlock/baseFeePerGas
  - set by network, based of demand
  - full block increases by 12.5%
  - target 50% block
  - burned rather than given to miner, prevent miners from manipulating the base fee by artificially filling blocks
  - 
- priority_fee/inclusion_fee
  - paid to a miner for prioritizing a transaction
- Gas
  - measure of how many resources a transaction uses
- eth_gasPrice/gasPrice
  - represents the amount a user is willing to pay, per gas, to have their transaction mined
- Total_cost
  - Pre: Gas * gasPrice
  - gasUsed * effectiveGasPrice
- Returned from Chain
  - effectiveGasPrice: price per gas at the time of your transaction
    - minimum of (baseFeeForBlock + maxPriorityFeePerGas) and maxFeePerGas
  - cumulativeGasUsed: all gas used by the entire block
  - gasUsed:  total amount of gas used by this specific transaction


Workings
- generally on maxPriorityFeePerGas will be set by user since base_fee is set by n/w
- however one can still set both maxPriorityFeePerGas and maxFeePerGas
- base_fee and priority_fee are not settable parameters
- Cases:
  - tobe included asap: set maxPriorityFeePerGas
  - tobe included asap, but dont wat to overpay : set maxPriorityFeePerGas
  - no rush: set maxFeePerGas, since you want to confirm but dont like the base_fee now
- max used since possible to confirm transaction for less, refer to values returned from chain
- min used to detremine gas charged and works intandem with max declaration usage

Problems pre 1559
- blind auction
- overpaying within the same block

Benefits
-  blocks are limited to roughly 15 million total gas, no matter how many transactions are waiting to be mined
- the block size can increase based on demand to roughly 2x that size, up to 30 million gas
