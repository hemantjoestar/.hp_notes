=== Notes ===

=== Implement ===
1. compute a domain hash which captures the configuration data of contract address and chainId
2. compute typed data hash
3. combine both hashes and use it inside ecrecover

For actual use recommended
- Openzepplins libraries for EIP712 and ECDSA
- [[https://github.com/pcaversaccio/snekmate/blob/main/src/utils/EIP712DomainSeparator.vy|vyper version .. safe?]]


=== Terms ===
- The signing algorithm of choice in Ethereum is secp256k1
- The hashing algorithm of choice is keccak256
- Brief refer to links for more details
  - 3 main signing methods
  - eth_sign
    - open-ended signing method that allows signing an arbitrary hash, which means it can be used to sign transactions
    - dangerous phishing risk
    - get users to sign data which is actually a transaction
    - if one was to sign transaction data, the added prefix string would make it an invalid transaction
    - ease of use and exiting infrastructure
  - personal_sign
    - added a prefix to the data so it could not impersonate transactions
    - `\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n`
    - human readable text when UTF-8 encoded
    - text-prefix made those signatures expensive to verify on-chain
    - hardware wallets currently only support
  - signTypedData/_v4
    - [[https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html#sign-typed-data-v4|Sign Typed Data Message Parameters]]
- DOMAIN_SEPARATOR
  - ensures different signatures for the same messages by the same user in two different Dapps
  - value unique to each domain that is ‘mixed in’ the signature
