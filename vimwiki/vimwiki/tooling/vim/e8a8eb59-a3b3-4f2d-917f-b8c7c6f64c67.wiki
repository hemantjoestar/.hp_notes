=== Notes ===

- Surrounding with `<s>` = html-tags , paranthessis, brackets, quotes
  - if not already surrounded, essentially applyting a surround
    - `ysiw<s>` surround inner word with tag
    - `yss<s>` surround line with tag
  - already surrounded
    - makes sense to use `c` for change
    - `cs<s1><s2>` change surrounding `s1` to `s2`
    - `ds<s>` delete surrounding `s` tag
    - deleting and changing automatically searched for nearest `s`and changes.. Hence eno need for sentence or word setting input
  - revert
    - `ds<s>` `s` can be either opening or closing
  - Special
    - open close tags `ysiw<em>` will autoinsert `</em>`. requires `<s>` arrow brackets
    - `t` will catch html tags
  - Visual mode .. didnt understand
