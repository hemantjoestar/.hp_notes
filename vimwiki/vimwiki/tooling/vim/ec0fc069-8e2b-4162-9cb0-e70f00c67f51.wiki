=== Notes ===

- prefer custom spelling file. method described in 2nd reference. else stuff gets added to default spell file created
- `:setlocal spellfile=~/.vim/spell/crypto.utf-8.add` for my vimwiki
- `setlocal spelllang=`
- concept of internal wordlist, bad word list and suggestions file
- also can mark words as wrong `zw`
- keys
  - z=
  - ]s, [s
  - zg, zug .. to add to spell file
- if adding to spell file directly `mk-spell`
