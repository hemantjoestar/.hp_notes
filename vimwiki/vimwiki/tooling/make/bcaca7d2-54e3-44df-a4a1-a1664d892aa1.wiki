Useful shorts
- To use a Makefile with a different name, use the -f flag e.g.
`make -f build-files/analyze.mk`
- To see the actions Make will run when building a target, without running the actions, use the --dry-run flag e.g.
`make --dry-run isles.dat`
- `NAME := VALUE` that can be refered by ${NAME} or $(NAME)
- `NAME ?= VALUE` Assign VALUE to the variable NAME if itâ€™s not yet defined.
  - `make BUILD=RELEASE ENVIRONMENT=PRODUCTION`
- alias `NAME = VALUE`
  - right hand side will be evaluated every time variable is accessed
  - `v1 := $(shell ls); v2 = $(shell ls)`
  - Both variables hold the result of the shell ls command execution, but v1 will be evaluated only once, and will never show any new files.
