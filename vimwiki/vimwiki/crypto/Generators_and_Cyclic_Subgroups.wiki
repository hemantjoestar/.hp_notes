- generating subgroups from elements in finite Abelian groups; 
- definitions and examples of subgroup generators, 
- subgroup order, cyclic subgroups, 
- Lagrange-Theorem

- subgroup in an Abelian Group is a subset of the Abelian Group that itself is an Abelian Group.
- The subgroup and its parent group are using the same operation

- subgroup generator is an element in an Abelian Group that can be used to generator a subgroup
- Order of Element least positive integer m exists, such that mP = 0 is 
- Every element in an finite Abelian group is a subgroup generator. 
- The Order of the generated subgroup is the same as the order of the element.

- Lagrange Theorem 
- the order of any subgroup in an finite Abelian group divides the order of the parent group
- x is cofactor of subgroup S $n*x = l$
- finite Abelian group G with an order of l and subgroup S with an order of n

- Cyclic Group
- finite Abelian group that can be generated by a single element
