Asymmetric key cryptosystems / public-key cryptosystems

provide 
- key-pair generation (private + public key)
- encryption algorithms RSA-OAEP and ECIES
- digital signature algorithms DSA, ECDSA and EdDSA
- key exchange algorithms  DHKE and ECDH

A message encrypted by the public key is later decrypted by the private key. 
A message signed by the private key is later verified by the public key


RSA public-key cryptosystem is based on the mathematical concept of modular exponentiation (numbers raised to a power by modulus)
along with some mathematical constructions and the integer factorization problem 
(which is considered to be computationally infeasible for large enough keys)


Curve25519 and Curve448
algebraic structure of the elliptic curves over finite fields
elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP), which is considered to be computationally infeasible for large keys
smaller keys, shorter signatures and better performance


Integrated encrypted schemes
which combine asymmetric encryption with symmetric key ciphers

KEM block (encapsulated key called "ephemeral symmetric key", with public key encryption) 
DEM block (encapsulated data, with symmetric encryption)

EIS schemes provide also message authentication
DLIES (Discrete Logarithm Integrated Encryption Scheme) and ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme).

Key wrapping refers to symmetric-key encryption of another key (which can be either a symmetric key or an asymmetric key)
used to encrypt, integrity-protect and transport cryptographic keys

digital signatures provide message authentication, integrity and non-repudiation
RSA and ECC provide secure digital signature schemes like DSA, ECDSA and EdDSA


Key Exchange Algorithms
- exchanged between two parties, allowing the use of a cryptographic algorithm, in most cases symmetric encryption cipher
- aptop connects to the home WiFi router, both parties agree on a session key, used to symmetrically encrypt the network traffic between them
- Anonymous key exchange, like Diffieâ€“Hellman (DHKE and ECDH),
- Authenticated key agreement schemes authenticate the identities of parties involved in the key exchange PKI certificate
