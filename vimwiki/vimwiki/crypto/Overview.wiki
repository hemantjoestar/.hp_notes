- Cryptography is the science of providing security and protection of information
- deals with storing and transmitting data in a secure way, such that only those, for whom it is intended, can read and process it
- encrypting and decrypting data using symmetric or asymmetric encryption
- one or more keys are used to transform data from plain to encrypted form and back
- Symmetric encryption (like AES, Twofish and ChaCha20)
- asymmetric encryption uses a public-key cryptosystem (like RSA or ECC) and a key-pair: public key (encryption key) and corresponding private key (decryption key). 
- Encryption algorithms are often combined in encryption schemes (like AES-256-CTR-HMAC-SHA-256, ChaCha20-Poly1305 or ECIES-secp256k1-AES-128-GCM)
- key derivation algorithms (like PBKDF2 and Scrypt)
-  means of digital signing of messages which guarantee message authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation
- random numbers and deals with entropy (unpredictable randomness) and secure generation of random numbers (e.g. using CSPRNG)
- key-exchange algorithms (like Diffie-Hellman key exchange and ECDH) and key establishment schemes, used to securely establish encryption keys between two parties that intend to transmit messages securely using encryption
-  cryptographic hash functions (like SHA-3 and BLAKE2), which transform messages to message digest (hash of fixed length), which cannot be reversed back to the original message and almost uniquely identifies the input
- Password hashing and password to key derivation functions (like Scrypt and Argon2) protect user passwords and password encrypted documents and data by securely deriving a hash (or key) from a text-based passwords, injecting random parameters (salt)
- ncryption algorithms and random generators follow the Shannon's principles of confusion and diffusion. 
  - Confusion means that each bit in the output form a cipher should depend on several parts of the key and input data and thus direct mapping cannot be established. 
  - Diffusion means that changing one bit in the input should change approximately half of the bits in the output.
These principles are incorporated in most hash functions, MAC algorithms, random number generators, symmetric and asymmetric ciphers.
