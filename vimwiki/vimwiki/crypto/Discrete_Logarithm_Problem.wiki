- performing the Abelian Group operation on two identical elements
- this operation is called 
  - Squaring in multiplicative notation or $P^2 = P * P$
  - Doubling in additive notation $2P = P + P$
- generalize the concept of Doubling or Squaring or operation 
- we will have the Scalar Multiplication or Exponentiation operation
- represent the process of performing Abelian Group operations consecutively n times with the same element
- "Scalar Multiplication" in additive notation $P + P + ... + P = nP$

- Trapdoor Function - An operation that is much easier to perform than its reverse operation
- Scalar Multiplication on Elliptic Curve is a good Trapdoor Function
