one of the first public-key cryptosystems
Rivest–Shamir–Adleman


keys of length: 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096, 8129, 16384 or even more bits
3072-bits and above are considered secure

RSA Key Generation
- very large integers e, d and n
- n is called "modulus" and it defines the RSA key length 2048-bit
- e is called "public key exponent". It is usually 65537 (0x010001), 24-bit
- {n, e} is the public key
- d is called "private key exponent" (the secret exponent) 2048-bit
- {n, d} is the private key
