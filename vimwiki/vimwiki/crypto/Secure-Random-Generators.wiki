- PRNG and CSPRNG
- cryptography the randomness (entropy) plays very important role
- pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is used to stretch a small amount of initial randomness
- PRNGs are not cryptographically secure and are different from CSPRNGs
- PRNGs fucntions start from some initial entropy (seed) and calculate the next random number by some calculation which is unpredictable without knowing the seed
- mot secure for crypto
- cryptography cannot work without unpredictable randomness
- hence CPRNGs, properties that make them suitable for use in cryptography
  - next bit test
  - state compromise extensions. knowing initial state is not enough
- DEsigns
  -  block ciphers
  - number theory . IFP, DLP, ECDLP
- OS randomness is usually accessible from /dev/random and /dev/urandom
