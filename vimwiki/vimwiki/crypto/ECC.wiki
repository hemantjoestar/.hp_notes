- algebraic structures of the elliptic curves over finite fields
- difficulty of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)

- pvt keys : 256 bit
- public keys: integer coordinates {x, y}, laying on the curve
- special properties, EC points can be compressed
- 257-bit integer, one coordinate + 1 bit (odd or even)
- different underlying elliptic curves
- different level of security (cryptographic strength), different performance (speed) and different key length
 
- secp256k1 or Curve25519
- field size (which defines the key length, e.g. 256-bit)
- security strength (usually the field size / 2 or less)

- digital signature algorithms ECDSA EdDSA
- Encryption EEECC(EC based Elgamal)
- key agreement ECDH, X25519 and FHMQV


- Cryptography uses elliptic curves in a simplified form (Weierstras form)
- over the finite field Fp (where p is prime and p > 3)
- or F2m (size p =2m)
- field is a square matrix of size p x p and the points are limited to integer coordinates within the field only
- and satisfy said Weierstras equation
- RSA, which uses for its key space the integers in the range [0...p-1] (the field ℤp)
- ECC uses the points {x, y} within the Galois field Fp (where x and y are integers in the range [0...p-1])


Order and Cofactor of Elliptic Curve
- order of the curve is the total number of all EC points on the curve
- includes also the special point called "point at infinity", which is obtained when a point is multiplied by 0
- Some curves form a single cyclic group (holding all their EC points)
- several non-overlapping cyclic subgroups (each holding a subset of the curve's EC points)
- points on the curve are split into h cyclic subgroups (partitions), 
- each of order r (each subgroup holds equal number of points)
- order of entire group is n = h * r
- number of subgroups h holding the EC points is called cofactor
- IMP. the points over an elliptic curve stay in one or several non-overlapping subsets
- cofactor = 1 is secp256k1
- cofactor = 8 is Curve25519
- cofactor = 4 is Curve448


Generator Point
- special pre-defined (constant) EC point, G
- Base point
- can generate any other point in its subgroup by multiplying G by some integer in the range [0...r]
- r is called "order" of the cyclic subgroup
- defines the total number of all possible private keys aka key space
- Elliptic curve subgroups usually have many generator points
- select carefully the elliptic curve domain parameters (curve equation, generator point, cofactor, etc.) 
- to ensure that the key space is large enough
- suitable for performance optimizations in the computations
- r * G = 0 * G = infinity


- It is known that for some curves different generator points generate subgroups of different order
- if the group order is n, for each prime d dividing n, there is a point Q such that d * Q = infinity
- means that some points used as generators for the same curve will generate smaller subgroups than others
-  "small-subgroup" attacks
- cryptographers usually choose the subgroup order r to be a prime number
- cofactor h > 1, different base points can generate different subgroups of EC points on the curve
- Ex.
  - y2 ≡ x3 + 7 mod 17
  - G = {15, 13} as generator, n =18, h = 1
  - curve order is 18, infinity point
  - curve order is not prime number, different generators may generate subgroups of different order
  - point {5, 9} as generator, it will generate just 3 EC points: {5, 8}, {5, 9} and infinity


- very fast to calculate P = k * G
- in time log_2(k_), e.g. the "double-and-add algorithm"
- extremely slow (considered infeasible for large k) to calculate k = P / G
- ECDLP problem
- The multiplication of elliptic curve points in the group Fp is similar to exponentiation of integers in the group ℤp
- to achieve a k-bit security strength, at least 2*k-bit curve is needed
- solve the ECDLP for key of size k needs sqrt(k)steps

- Weierstrass curves, with an equation of the form y2=x3+ax+b
- Montgomery curve, with an equation of the form By2=x3+Ax2+x
