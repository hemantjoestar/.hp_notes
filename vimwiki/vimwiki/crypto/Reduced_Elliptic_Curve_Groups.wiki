1. we know elliptic equations in 2-dimensional real number space to construct Abelian groups
2. in 2-dimensional integer space?? No we cannot
3. Solnt. we elliptic curves reduced by modular arithmetic of prime numbers
4. However Abelian condition still left, Above only gives us integers ex. Closure of 2P might fail
5. Problem being m used in calculations, if m an integer no probs, however m is rational as formula
6. Applying modular arithmetic to rationals is tricky
7. Modular Arithmetic Reduction on Rational Numbers = modular multiplication of the numerator and the multiplicative inverse of the denominator
8. modular multiplicative inverse of an integer, use Extended Euclidean Algorithm
9. Som we finally arrive at Reduced Elliptic Curve Group


- Hasses theorem: order of group is bound by a range
- EC can also be constructed from prime power numbers
