Symmetric
- combines several crypto algorithms into an symmetric encryption scheme
- encryption scheme (cipher construction)
  - key derivation algorithm
  - symmetric cipher
  - cipher blockmode
  - message authentication to provide integrity and authenticity
- secret keys
  - password-to-key-derivation scheme to extract a secret key from certain password, 
  - users tend to remember passwords easier than binary data


- Symmetric encryption algorithms 
- (ciphers) are: AES (AES-128, AES-192, AES-256), ChaCha20, Twofish, IDEA, Serpent, Camelia 
- block ciphers (encrypt data by blocks of fixed size, e.g. 128 bits),
- stream ciphers (encrypt data byte by byte as a stream)
- Block ciphers can be turned into stream ciphers by using a technique called "cipher block mode"



- public key cryptography uses a different key to encrypt and decrypt data (or to sign and verify messages)
- public + private key pairs.
- Asymmetric cryptography deals with encrypting and decrypting messages using a public / private key, 
  - signing messages, 
  - verifying signatures and 
  - securely exchanging keys
- RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman), ECC (elliptic curve cryptography), Diffie-Hellman, ECDH, ECDSA and EdDSA


- public-key cryptosystems can encrypt messages of limited length only and are slower than symmetric ciphers
- encrypting longer messages
-  key encapsulation mechanism (KEM): 
  - encapsulate an asymmetrically-encrypted random (ephemeral) symmetric key
  - use symmetric algorithm for the data encryption
  - for encryption a random symmetric key sk is generated, 
  - the message is symmetrically encrypted by sk, 
  - then sk is asymmetrically encrypted using the recipient's public key
  - decryption, first the sk key is asymmetrically decrypted using the recipient's private key
  - ciphertext is decrypted symmetrically using sk

- Digital signatures provide message authentication, message integrity and non-repudiation
- encrypt data by a private key and decrypt it by the public key. 
- Thus someone can prove that he is owner of certain private key, while revealing only its corresponding public key

- signed blockchain transaction holds a proof of authorship:
- it is guaranteed mathematically that the signature is created by the holder of certain blockchain address and 
- the transaction was not modified after the signing

Key pairs
- ECC, the public key can be calculated from the private key
- RSA, the public key and the private key are generated together but cannot be directly calculated from each other
- Public key is encapsulated in a digital certificate, which binds certain identity (e.g. person or Internet domain name) to certain public key
- blockchain address is derived from the public key (by hashing and other transformations)
