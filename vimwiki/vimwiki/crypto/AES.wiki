- symmetric key block cipher algorithm
- block size of 128 bits
- symmetric keys of length 128, 160, 192, 224 and 256 bits
- TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
- modern CPU hardware implements


- AES encryption, combined with CTR block mode and random IV causes the encryption algorithm to produce different encrypted ciphertext each time, when the same input data is encrypted
- AES encryption in CBC mode uses a padding algorithm (like PKCS7 or ANSI X.923
- help splitting the input data into blocks of fixed block-size (e.g. 128 bits) before passing the blocks to the AES-CBC algorithm
- AES algorithm often is used along with a password-to-key derivation function, e.g. Scrypt(passwd) -> key or PBKDF2(passwd) -> key


Integrated Message Authentication Code (MAC)
- check the password validity
- typically integrated in the algorithm's output
- calculated from the input message, together with the encryption key
- t is impossible to reveal the input message or the key, so the MAC itself is not a secret

The AES Encryption Process
1. Algorithm parameters are selected
  1. ES, 128-bit, CTR mode + Scrypt + Scrypt parameters + MAC algorithm
  2. same parameters for encryption and decryption
2. encryption key is derived from the encryption password using a key-derivation function (KDF), e.g. Scrypt
3. AES encryption algorithm. generates a random salt (IV) and uses it to transform the input msg using the encryption key
4. output the ciphertext + the randomly generated IV (128-bit salt) + the MAC code
5. HMAC code calculated from the input msg, using the encryption key (or some transformation of it) and some MAC function (like HMAC-SHA-256)

The AES Decryption Process
1. 3 inputs from above
2. In case of authenticated encryption (like AES-GCM), the integrated MAC code is verified 
3. In case of unauthenticated encryption
  1. Calculate HMAC of the original message (obtained during the decryption)
  2. Compare the encryption MAC ?? against what to compare
